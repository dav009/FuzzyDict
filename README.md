# FuzzyDict

Fast Fuzzy String matching dictionary. Based on `Simple and Efficient Algorithm
for Approximate Dictionary Matching` by `Naoaki Okazaki` and `Junâ€™ichi Tsujii` [1].

## Usage

```scala 

    val fuzzyHash = FuzzyMap(List( ("Barack Obama", "ID1"),
                                   ("Barack O", "ID2"),
                                   ("Barack", "ID3"),
                                    ("Washington", "ID4")))


    fuzzyHash.get("Barack", 1.0, Cosine)
    // Some(List("ID3"))

    fuzzyHash.getMatches("Barack", 0.5, Cosine)
    // Some(List(("Barack", "ID3"), ("Barack O", "ID2"), ("Barack Obama", "ID1")))
```

 - Fuzzy Matches: 
    - Cosine
    - Dice (soon)
    - Jaccard (soon)


## When to Use?
 
 Finding fuzzy matches among the items in the hash is very fast.
 This is useful in scenarios when you have a massive number of Strings which you want to constantly query using Fuzzy Search.
